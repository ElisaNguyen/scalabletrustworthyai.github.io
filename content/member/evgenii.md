My personal page is at [kortukov.github.io](https://kortukov.github.io).

I am currently pursuing my MSc degree in Machine Learning at the [University of Tübingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/), supervised by Seong Joon Oh, Elisa Nguyen and Alexander Rubinstein.
My research interests primarily revolve around mitigating the [risks associated with increasingly powerful ML systems](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/artificial-intelligence/).
My current focus involves exploring data-driven explainability methods and their application to language models.

I receieved my Bachelor degree in Computer Science from [Lomonosov Moscow State University](https://www.msu.ru/en/) in 2020. During and after my studies, I worked for about 2.5 years as a software engineer at [Yandex](https://yandex.com/company).
Prior to joining the STAI group, I had the opportunity to work as a student research assistant in the [Decision Making group](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/informatik/lehrstuehle/decision-making/) at the University of Tübingen.
