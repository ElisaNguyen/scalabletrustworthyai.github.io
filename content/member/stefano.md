I am a PhD student in the International Max-Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems ([IMPRS-IS](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/)), supervised by Christian Baumgartner and co-supervised by Seong Joon Oh at the University of Tübingen.

I work on few-shot learning and domain generalisation for medical image analysis. I am passionate about developing more “human-like” machine learning methods, which mimic our ability to make predictions based on a limited number of training examples and to generalise to unsee tasks.

Before joining the University of Tübingen, I obtained my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from University of Konstanz and my Master’s degree in Computer Science from ETH Zürich, focusing mainly on Machine Leanring and on Computer Vision.
