I am a first year PhD student in the Scalable Trustworthy AI (STAI) group at the [Tübingen AI Center](https://tuebingen.ai/). 

I received my Master’s degree in Computer Science from University of Tübingen in 2022, and Bachelor’s in Computer Science from [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/) in 2019. I am interested in understanding abstractions humans and neural networks perform in visual representations and how to use these to improve model robustness and Human-Computer Interaction.
