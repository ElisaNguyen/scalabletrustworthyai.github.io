I am a PhD student, co-supervised by [Cristòbal Curio](https://cogsys.reutlingen-university.de/about-us/members/cristobal-curio/?L=1) at Reutlingen University and [Seong Joon Oh](https://coallaoh.github.io/) at the University of Tübingen. My personal page is at [lennartbramlage.com](https://lennartbramlage.com).

A broader interest in decision making under uncertainty has informed my current focus on rapid and accurate uncertainty estimation in deep neural networks. I believe that the quantification and source-attribution of their failures is indispensable wherever these models interface with real world systems, be it in autonomous driving or widely accessible large language models.

I received my MSc in Intelligent Systems at [Bielefeld University](https://www.uni-bielefeld.de/), completing my thesis in cooperation with [ATR Institute International](https://www.atr.jp/index_e.html) in Kyoto, Japan, and a BA in Human-Computer Interaction from the [University of Applied Science Osnabrück](https://www.hs-osnabrueck.de/) where I worked on my thesis at the [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems Software Workshop](https://is.mpg.de/en/software-workshop).
