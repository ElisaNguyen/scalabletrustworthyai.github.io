I am a first-year PhD Student at the [T端bingen AI Center](https://tuebingen.ai/), [University of T端bingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/), supervised by [Seong Joon Oh](https://coallaoh.github.io/). My personal webpage is at [ankitsonthalia.com](https://ankitsonthalia.com).

The [simplicity bias](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/file/6cfe0e6127fa25df2a0ef2ae1067d915-Paper.pdf) often causes machine learning models to learn semantically meaningless, "spurious" correlations between inputs and outputs. This phenomenon hurts generalization, thus leading to often unpredictable failure cases and our inability to trust AI systems. I'm interested in understanding how to encourage ML models to learn more meaningful, causal correlations instead. Better generalization capability and trustworthiness would follow as direct consequences. 

I obtained my Bachelor and Master degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics, respectively, in 2022, from a five-year integrated program at [BITS Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/), Pilani campus, India. During this time, I worked on a Computer Vision project at the [Augmented Vision Department, German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI)](https://av.dfki.de/), led by [Prof. Dr. Didier Stricker](https://av.dfki.de/members/stricker); and another under the supervision of [Bharath Ramesh](https://www.westernsydney.edu.au/icns/about/people/researchers/dr_bharath_ramesh) at the [Western Sydney University](https://www.westernsydney.edu.au/). After that, I went on to further explore my science and engineering interests as a research software engineer at the T端bingen AI Center, where I collaborated with STAI for a year, before joining the group as a PhD student.
